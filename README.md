# Workspace Creator

Desktop app and tools for deploying Databricks workspaces across AWS, Azure, and GCP with Unity Catalog, automated Terraform setup, Azure identity support, and an embedded AI assistant.

The AI assistant provides context-aware help for each step of the deployment wizard. It supports GitHub Models (free), OpenAI, and Claude as providers. See [desktop-app/README.md](desktop-app/README.md#ai-assistant) for setup instructions.

## Troubleshooting

For detailed troubleshooting, see [desktop-app/README.md#troubleshooting](desktop-app/README.md#troubleshooting).
